Hello!

I'm glad you decided to read the source code instead of just blindly using this!

I started this at 9:16 pm on a Thursday (after finishing COMP2123 A1) in response to numerous posts on Ed claiming that a restriction related to committing binary files was unfair.

I hope John gives me extra marks for writing this in C (he will not ðŸ˜”)

If anyone wants to contribute they are free to do so! I will not be spending anymore time on this after today.

Good luck everyone in COMP2017!

Cheers, Casey
